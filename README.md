Please develop an adaptive web page and speakers element.

## 1. Tech stack requirements

* **Markup:** you can use pure HTML or [Pug](https://pugjs.org/), without any frameworks (React, Vue.js, Angular, etc.).

# Veeam Software - Test task Dev Notes

Hi, there! my name is Valyn Hall and I'm a candidate for the open UI Developer position. This was a great task! I had to use all my juinor dev just out of school powers to remember all the vanillaJS and plain CSS pitfalls and quirks, it was a fun challenge not using any frameworks. Probably my favorite takehome so far. I appreciate your considration and I'm sorry for taking right up to the wire to finish. I was part of a bridal party in a wedding this weekend and I did get admonished once for coding in between taking pictures, lol. Looking forward to chatting soon!

Peace, love, and JavaScript <3

~Valyn Hall~
